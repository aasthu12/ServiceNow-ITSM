ServiceNow Incident & Change Analytics | Power BI
🔹 Business Problem

IT operations teams struggle to proactively manage incidents, meet SLAs, and understand the impact of changes on service stability.
This project analyzes ServiceNow Incident and Change data to identify bottlenecks, SLA risks, and performance gaps.

🔹 Tools & Technologies

Power BI

DAX

ServiceNow-style datasets (Incidents & Changes)

🔹 Key KPIs

Total Incidents & Open Backlog

MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution)

SLA Compliance % & Breach Count

Incident Aging & Backlog Risk

Engineer-wise Performance

Change-related Incident Impact

🔹 Dashboard Pages

1. Incident Overview

Incident volume, status distribution, priority analysis

Time-series trend analysis

2. Incident Management

MTTR, SLA compliance, engineer workload

Category & priority breakdown

3. SLA & Aging Analysis

SLA breach monitoring

Aging buckets and oldest open incidents

Backlog risk assessment

4. Change Management

Change volume, risk, emergency changes

Average change duration

5. Incident ↔ Change Correlation

Incidents caused by changes

MTTR comparison (with vs without changes)

Priority & category-wise impact

🔹 Advanced Analytics Implemented

MTTR calculation using DAX

SLA risk categorization (Low / Medium / High / Breached)

Incident aging buckets

Engineer performance normalization

Change impact on incident resolution

🔹 Sample Insights

High priority incidents contribute disproportionately to SLA breaches

Incidents linked to emergency changes show higher MTTR

Backlog is concentrated in long-aging buckets, posing SLA risk

Certain assignment groups consistently exceed resolution targets
